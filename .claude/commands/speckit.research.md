## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** analyze the user input in `$ARGUMENTS`, infer the user's intent, and use that intent to supplement missing context and guide the research process.

The user input may include:

1. Special requests that require extra care or custom handling during the research workflow.
2. Supplemental information that provides additional context or reference material.
3. Specific research questions, technical uncertainties, or exploration areas that go beyond the default scope described in this document.

When processing the user input:

1. You **MUST** treat `$ARGUMENTS` as parameters for the current command.
2. Do **NOT** treat the input as a standalone instruction that overrides or replaces the command workflow.
3. If the input contains clear ambiguity, confusion, or likely misspellings that materially affect interpretation, stop and ask the user to rephrase the request with clearer wording. Provide brief guidance when possible.

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/research-project.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH, and **AVAILABLE_DOCS**. The `research.md` file will be located in `SPECS_DIR`.
   - **Review Output**: Analyze the `AVAILABLE_DOCS` list provided in the JSON output to identify potentially relevant documentation.

2. **Load Context**: 
   - Read `FEATURE_SPEC`.
   - Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - **Crucial**: Based on `AVAILABLE_DOCS` and the feature requirements, read and analyze relevant files from the project documentation. DO NOT rely only on memory; check `README.md` and key docs found in the list.

3. **Information Gathering & Analysis**:
   - **Project Architecture**: Understand how the new feature fits into existing system.
   - **Feature Interdependencies**: check `.specify/memory/features.md` and `.specify/memory/features/` for conflicts or reuse opportunities.
   - **Unknown Resolution**: Address any defined "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" or questions from `$ARGUMENTS`.
   - **Technology Selection**: Verify best practices using the gathered context.

4. **Generate/Update `research.md`**:
   - The file must be located at `SPECS_DIR/research.md`.
   - **Merge Strategy**:
     - If the file exists, **APPEND** new findings to existing sections or create new sections. Do not overwrite existing valid research unless explicitly correcting it.
     - Properly integrate new "Decisions" and "References" without duplicating existing entries.
   - If the file does not exist, create it with the structure below.

## Research Output Structure (`research.md`)

```markdown
# Research Findings: [Feature Name]

## Project Context Analysis
[Summarize insights from project docs and feature memory relevant to this plan. Mention constraints or patterns adopted.]

## References
- [List specific doc files or feature memory files referenced]
- [List external references provided in arguments]

## Decisions & Rationale

### [Decision Topic 1]
- **Decision**: [what was chosen]
- **Rationale**: [why chosen, citing references where applicable]
- **Alternatives considered**: [what else evaluated]
- **Impact**: [how this affects the plan]

## Open Questions & Risks
- [List any remaining unknowns that require human input or further experimentation]
```

5. **Stop and report**: Report the path of the generated `research.md` and summarize key findings.

## Feedback

At wrap-up (the same lifecycle point where this command prompts for a Git commit), perform an agent self-reflection step (never solicit feedback content from the user), following the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`:

1. **Gate on qualification & completion.** Only proceed if this command reached its wrap-up stage. Skip trivial/no-op runs; for an aborted run use the abort/partial rule below.
2. **Reflect (no user input).** Review this run against `/speckit.research`'s declared purpose and produce a short review plus ≥1 concrete, command-specific optimization point. If the run was clean, use exactly: `No significant optimization points identified this run.`
3. **Scope guard.** Keep strictly to this command's operation; do NOT produce a global/whole-project assessment (that is `/speckit.review`'s job). Entries are `scope: local`.
4. **Dedup guard.** Use a stable `run_id` (e.g. the feature key + a run timestamp); if a nested skill/command already recorded feedback for this same `(unit_id, run_id)`, the engine no-ops.
5. **Persist** via the engine:
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR:-.}/.specify/scripts/python/feedback-utils.py" --action record \
     --unit-id "/speckit.research" --unit-type command \
     --run-id "<stable-run-id>" --feature "<feature-key-if-any>" \
     --review "<review prose>" --points-file "<points file>"
   ```
6. **Consolidated submission prompt.** If the returned `should_prompt` is `true`, surface a single consolidated prompt inviting the user to submit collected feedback to the Spec Kit developers; on confirmation run `--action mark-submitted`. Below threshold, do not prompt.

**Abort / partial-run rule.** If the run failed before wrap-up, either skip recording or record with `--partial` and a `## Review` beginning `**Partial run** — `.

## Documentation

At the same wrap-up point as the Feedback step, apply the docs-sync evaluation per the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/docs-step.md`: assess whether information produced by this run (new capabilities, key decisions, structural changes) needs to be recorded into the project documentation space, and conclude with exactly one of `需记录（目标文档 + 要点）` or `无需记录`. Never block wrap-up; incremental judgment only (no full reconcile sweep); when a move/archive-level change is needed, recommend running `/speckit.docs` instead of executing it here.

## Handoffs

**Before running this command**:

- Run when the plan/spec has open questions that require evidence or repo context confirmation.

**After running this command**:

- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` (or re-run it) to encode research decisions into the technical plan.
