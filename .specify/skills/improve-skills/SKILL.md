# improve-skills

## Goal

Continuously improve one existing local SpecKit Skill from a user-provided Skill description and evidence from real executions. The expected result is a focused Skill update that fixes observed problems, captures reusable lessons, and makes the next execution more reliable.

Goal anchor (Constitution Principle XIII): this skill is a Better-Harness instrument — improving a Skill strengthens the **Controlled Execution** dimension (the supported, repeatable path the Skill provides) and closes the **Learning Capture** loop; goal model in `.specify/shared/guidelines/better-harness.md`.

## Input Contract

The input is a description of the Skill to improve. It must be interpreted as follows:

- **Target identifier**: identify exactly one local Skill by `skill_id`, frontmatter `name`, canonical path, or Skill directory name. If multiple Skills match or no local Skill can be found, ask one targeted clarification before editing.
- **Batch mode (explicit multi-skill request)**: when the user explicitly names a *set* of Skills (or a whole skills directory), do not force single-target resolution and do not loop the full workflow N times blindly. Run one batch pass: (1) collect evidence **once** for the batch, then derive per-skill candidates; (2) **freeze the per-skill candidate list** before editing — no mid-batch additions; (3) prefer **mechanical, sanctioned conformance edits applied directly** (Feedback-section conformance, legacy path idioms, dead links, missing script refs) over speculative per-skill rewrites; (4) verify mirror/write-through **once at the end** for the whole batch (e.g. `diff -rq`). A batch that repeatedly fails on speculative rewrites should be restarted in this minimal-edit shape rather than retried harder.
- **Intent routing guard**: when the description's intent is to **monitor or evaluate an ongoing execution process** ("continuously watch/score another agent's work") rather than to modify a specific Skill, this skill is the wrong entry point — editing a SKILL.md directly conflicts with monitoring red lines (zero writes to the monitored target). Route such requests to a `continuous` monitoring team (`create-team` / `improve-team`) and tell the user why, instead of forcing target-Skill resolution.
- **Optimization direction**: extract the requested direction when present, such as fixing execution failures, improving efficiency, clarifying inputs/outputs, correcting tool usage, or strengthening validation. If no direction is present, infer it only from concrete execution history and user feedback.
- **User emphasis**: treat details in the user's description as high-priority evidence. Analyze them explicitly even when broader execution history suggests additional improvements.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the target Skill, optimization direction, and execution window**
   - Parse the user's Skill description for a `skill_id`, frontmatter `name`, canonical path, or Skill directory name; improve only that local Skill.
   - If the user says “this Skill”, infer the target from the active file or recent conversation, then verify it resolves to exactly one local Skill.
   - Extract the requested optimization direction when present and carry it through evidence collection, analysis, edits, validation, and reporting.
   - Treat `.specify/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` as the canonical source of truth; use `.github/skills/<name>` only as a compatibility entrypoint.
   - Re-read the canonical `SKILL.md` before editing, especially when the system reports recent user or formatter changes, or when a refresh/script may have modified metadata.
   - Define the execution window to review: current conversation, last Skill run, failed command output, user correction, test failure, or recent edits.
   - When improving `improve-skills` itself, use the most recent improvement loop as the execution window and avoid reapplying the same lesson unless new evidence shows the previous fix was insufficient.

2. **Measure execution effectiveness from evidence (evidence-step A/B)**
   - Execute Step A/B per `.specify/shared/workflow/evidence-step.md` (single source of truth; do not restate its rules here): reuse fresh findings via `evidence-utils.py --action latest --target skill:<name>`, or collect via `--action collect --target skill:<name> --lanes all` (session + feedback lanes carry the strongest signals for skill improvement: episode-level rework/failure evidence and recurring optimization themes with `recurrence` signals).
   - Triage findings evidence by `evidenceState` per the evidence-step table, then **freeze the candidate list** — later steps must not add or drop candidates. Red lines: `Unobserved` items are recorded only and MUST NOT be treated as defects to fix; counting signals MUST NOT directly generate optimization points.
   - **Degenerate-evidence fallback**: when the collected findings are effectively identical project-level output for every target (byte-identical digests across skills — no per-skill signal), do NOT fabricate per-skill defects from them. Restrict the candidate list to the standing sanctioned checks (Feedback-section conformance, legacy path idioms) plus **filesystem ground truth** (dead links, missing referenced scripts/files), and state the evidence limitation explicitly in the final report.
   - Gather concrete supplementary evidence from the current execution window: user feedback, steps that were confusing, tool failures, wrong assumptions, repeated manual fixes, validation gaps, and changed files from the execution.
   - Include terminal/test outputs and error messages when they explain what went wrong.
   - Review changed files as evidence, but classify generated validation artifacts such as `tools/*.json` separately from hand-edited Skill instructions.
   - Measure the target Skill against the requested or inferred optimization goal: whether it could be invoked, whether its expected input format was accepted, whether the workflow produced the expected output, how many avoidable manual/tool steps occurred, and whether validation caught the issue.
   - Identify the execution-flow steps that did not meet expectations, including broken command-line parameters, mismatched expected formats, missing prerequisites, ambiguous target resolution, inefficient tool choices, repeated searches, or unnecessary user handoffs.
   - Separate facts from interpretation. Do not optimize from generic best-practice principles when no execution evidence supports the change.
   - **Treat executor-reported runtime failures as first-class evidence, outranking any prior "it works" claim.** A reference/example snippet that throws or silently no-ops at runtime (missing module, a loop that toggles its own state, an extractor that skips iframes) is a confirmed defect even if the file exists and a previous run asserted the Skill was fine. Anchor the fix to the observed stack trace / wrong output, not to the earlier assertion; a stale "already works" is itself a finding to correct.
   - **Silent under-extraction counts as a defect, not just a throw.** When an executor reports a helper "ran fine" but returned *empty or thin* results (a select with no options, a dashboard with "0 panels", `variables: []` on a page that visibly has them), that is evidence the helper read the wrong/too-early DOM — not evidence the page is empty. Capture the executor's concrete observation (which selector matched 0 nodes, which content was missing) as the reusable fact; it is often more actionable than any error message because nothing crashed. Record it even when the run's headline metrics (coverage, screenshots) all look green.
   - If evidence is insufficient, ask one targeted question about what failed, what was inefficient, or what should happen differently next time.

3. **Analyze user-provided emphasis and organize improvement items**
   - Give the user's stated optimization direction a dedicated analysis pass: confirm which parts are already satisfied, which parts are missing, and which edits will directly address the request.
   - Group observations by failure mode: trigger/discovery, scope inference, missing context, wrong tool choice, unsafe step, unclear output, validation gap, resource/reference issue, **constraint non-compliance** (the Skill ran and the workflow was followed, but a hard rule was violated — a format mandate skipped, a conditional must not applied, banned wording used; diagnose as a constraint-*placement* problem per [`./references/constraint-placement.md`](./references/constraint-placement.md) before rewording the rule), or **cross-skill ownership boundary** (two sibling skills own overlapping artifact types with no documented boundary — e.g. capacity templates vs responsibility templates; the root cause is the undocumented boundary itself, not any single failing step, and the fix usually includes writing the boundary down in both skills).
   - For each item, record: observed symptom, likely cause in the current Skill instructions, desired next behavior, and the file section to change.
   - When an item must be **deferred for lack of execution evidence** (the no-fabrication discipline blocks writing it this loop), record **which concrete evidence would unlock it** — which scenario run, command output, or artifact would make it writable — so a later run can collect that evidence deliberately instead of leaving a generic "to be filled" backlog entry.
   - Discard one-off environment noise unless the Skill should explicitly handle it in future runs. If a refresh command exits successfully with a fallback after an optional source warning, record it as a validation note rather than a root cause.
   - **Legacy path idioms**: when the Skill under review still uses any of the following, flag them as migration candidates and apply the Migration Mapping table from `templates/commands/skills.md` (`## Migration Mapping`):
     - Bare relative paths such as `./scripts/init.sh` or `./references/checklist.md` → rewrite as `${SKILL_HOME}/...`.
     - `${SKILL_ROOT}/X` references → rewrite as `${SKILL_HOME}/X`.
     - Agent-specific install paths embedded in prose (e.g., `${HOME}/.copilot/skills/<name>/...`, hard-coded `.specify/skills/<name>/...`) → rewrite as `${SKILL_HOME}/...`.
   - **Feedback-section conformance (Feature 028)**: verify the Skill carries a `## Feedback` section as its final workflow section, beginning with the **runtime-mode gate** (see `.specify/shared/workflow/runtime-mode.md`). If the section is **missing**, repair it by appending the canonical block from `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md` (substituting `skill:<name>` / `--unit-type skill`). If it is **malformed** (missing the runtime-mode gate, the qualification/completion gate, the no-user-input reflection rule, the scope guard vs `/speckit.review`, the stable-`run_id` dedup guard, the `feedback-utils.py --action record` invocation, or the consolidated threshold-prompt behavior), realign it to the canonical block. Apply the fix to BOTH `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and `.specify/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. **Standalone-mode exception**: for a Skill living in a standalone (non–Spec Kit) skills directory — no `.specify/` at the working-directory root — the engine-backed block is NOT required; a self-contained gated reflection section is conformant, the dual-copy rule does not apply, and no registry/agent propagation repair should be attempted.

4. **Correct the root causes with minimal changes**
   - For complete execution failures, fix the instruction that caused non-execution first, such as wrong command-line arguments, nonexistent paths, invalid expected file formats, incompatible metadata, or missing prerequisite checks.
   - For successful but inefficient executions, replace the inefficient step with a more direct method, deterministic script, narrower search, better evidence filter, or clearer decision branch.
   - Prefer changing the step that caused the observed problem over adding broad new rules.
   - Convert repeated user corrections into explicit decision branches.
   - Convert repeated manual checks into checklist items or deterministic scripts when appropriate.
   - **Harden reference helpers that read a live third-party/framework DOM against the two recurring silent-under-extraction causes.** (1) *Interaction-gated content* — options, tab bodies, popovers, and menus that mount only on click (e.g. a component library's `<Select>` whose options render in a portal) cannot be read from a static-DOM scrape; the fix is a bounded open-then-read-then-close pass at the driver level, not a richer static selector. (2) *Version-drifting selectors* — third-party embeds (dashboards, editors) rename classes/`data-testid`s between versions, so a single selector silently matches 0 nodes; query the old **and** current shapes and treat an empty result on a page known to have the element as a drift signal to re-check, not as absence. Prefer these targeted robustness edits over widening the whole extractor. For concrete before/after code (the brittle version, the runtime symptom, the hardened version, and the general lesson) see [`./references/hardening-examples.md`](./references/hardening-examples.md).
   - **Prefer ground-truth signals over convenient-but-misleading ones, and scope extraction to the intended node.** A count or label the target system already prints (a "(0 panels)" row header, a "3 results" badge, a status pill) looks authoritative but is often a stale/partial/collapsed-state artifact — do not surface it as the fact. Derive the value from the underlying elements instead (count the real DOM nodes, read the actual list), and reconcile: when the emitted label disagrees with the element-level truth, treat the elements as authoritative and stop reporting the label. Likewise, when a broad selector's text is used as a field, confirm it captures only that field — a container/ancestor selector silently absorbs sibling/body content (a title jammed onto a whole table row, a name jammed onto its value). The fix is to scope the selector to the leaf/header node, not to post-filter the polluted string (length caps are a backstop, not the fix). Mislabeling one datum as another (a selected value reported as the variable's name) is the same class of error — verify each captured field is the thing the doc claims it is.
   - **For constraint non-compliance, fix placement before wording** — apply the evidence-based fix ladder in [`./references/constraint-placement.md`](./references/constraint-placement.md): consolidate hard constraints into one compact block positioned late in `SKILL.md`, restate the concrete rule text inline at the violating decision-point step, de-duplicate copies, pair prohibitions with the required alternative, and make completion conditions objective. Never accept a generic "strictly follow the constraints" reminder as the fix (measured no-op), and do not duplicate the block into multiple sections (measured to reduce compliance).
   - Move detailed lessons to `./references/` only when they are useful but not needed every run.
   - **Slim `SKILL.md` toward contract-only content**: when an edit touches `SKILL.md`, also evaluate whether existing sections should be moved out per [`./references/skill-slimming-principles.md`](./references/skill-slimming-principles.md). The body is a contract — frontmatter, resource index, workflow skeleton, strict requirements, and conventions — not a manual. How-to checklists, error tables, command-pair comparisons, environment-detection scripts, install commands, and intra-domain routing tables belong in references; replace them with a one-sentence pointer + anchor link. Always **delete-and-absorb** (copy the substantive content into the target reference in the same edit), never delete-and-drop. Defer environment-level recovery (auto-install, shell switching, OS branching) to the user — surface the error and fix command, then stop. **Never slim a section that a feature spec or contract test mandates be present inline.** Before moving/removing any named section (heading) out of `SKILL.md`, grep `.specify/specs/**` and `tests/contract/**` for that heading; if a contract asserts its inline presence (e.g. `## Agent-Specific Configuration` with `### Step 1/2/3` per `021-agent-specific-config` contract C-002), it is part of the skill's contract — keep it inline and slim elsewhere. Structural moves that a heading-grep test can see are the highest-risk slimming edits.
   - **Codify deterministic logic; reserve natural language for judgment.** While correcting root causes, also scan the Skill for deterministic logic still expressed as prose and extract it into executable scripts. The governing pattern is *deterministic logic → code, judgment logic → LLM*.
     - **Identify deterministic fragments**: path derivation, sequence/number incrementing, state detection, format/input validation, condition-branch decision trees, input/output transforms, and topological ordering are deterministic — they have one correct result for a given input. Framework/version detection, prerequisite checks, and structured parsing also qualify.
     - **Preset catalog + deterministic matcher**: when a skill repeatedly re-derives a whole artifact shape (team roster, config skeleton, document layout) from vague free-form input, the fix is a catalog of vetted presets plus a deterministic matcher that maps input signals to a preset — not a longer prose decision tree. Presets must be distilled from real, evidenced instances, and the matcher must be executed against sample inputs before wiring.
     - **Extract into a self-describing script**: move each identified fragment into a shell or python script under `${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/`. The script must accept structured input (CLI arguments or a stdin JSON payload), return structured output (JSON on stdout or an explicit exit code), and be self-documenting (a `--help` flag or a comment header stating purpose, inputs, and outputs).
     - **Reference the script from `SKILL.md`**: replace the prose describing the deterministic logic with a script-invocation instruction, e.g. run `${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/detect-framework.sh` and branch on its JSON output, instead of restating the detection steps in words.
     - **Keep judgment logic in natural language**: option trade-offs, quality review, intent understanding, and ambiguity resolution stay as LLM-directed prose — do not force these into scripts.
     - **Apply only when it pays off**: extract to a script when the deterministic logic meets *any* of these complexity signals: contains conditional branching (if/else, pattern matching), involves multi-step sequential operations with intermediate state, requires parsing or transformation of structured data, or is error-prone when restated in natural language (e.g. regex, path arithmetic, version comparisons). Line count alone does not indicate complexity — a single-line regex validation may warrant extraction while ten lines of straightforward enumeration may not. Additionally, the logic should recur across executions or across multiple Skills; truly one-off trivial checks can remain inline.

5. **Update the Skill for the next execution**
   - Edit `SKILL.md` to make the improved behavior executable and checkable.
   - Update frontmatter `description` only when execution feedback shows trigger/discovery mismatch.
   - Update `./references/`, `./scripts/`, or `./assets/` only when the evidence shows they will reduce future mistakes.
   - When Step 4 extracted deterministic logic into a new `${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/` script, list that script in the Resources table so the executable resource stays discoverable.
   - Avoid adding process logs, changelogs, or full retrospectives to the Skill; distill only reusable lessons.
   - **Rename/removal downstream-wiring checklist**: when the improvement renames, consolidates, or removes a skill, the edit is not done until every downstream pointer moves with it. In this repo that means: (1) add the old name to `_OBSOLETE_SKILLS` in `src/specify_cli/__init__.py`, extending the rename-chain comment; (2) rename/realign the skill's contract-test file and its assertions, including guards that the old name is gone (directory absent, obsolete-manifest entry, no stale registry rows); (3) update the `.specify/instructions.md` Skills registry row AND the skills-count list in the Key Directories section; (4) add a feature-history entry recording the rename and rationale; (5) fix stale pointers in artifacts the old skill dogfooded (e.g. report headers naming the predecessor skill). Sync the `skills/<name>/` ↔ `.specify/skills/<name>/` mirror with `\cp -rf` (plain `cp` may be aliased to `cp -i` and silently skip overwrites) and verify byte-equivalence with `diff -rq`.
   - **Move-then-edit order**: when a rename uses `git mv`, re-read the file at its NEW path before editing — file-editing tools reject writes to paths not yet read in-session, and edits aimed at the old path land nowhere.

6. **Validate the improvement loop**
   - Re-read the changed Skill and verify that each edit maps to an observed execution issue.
   - **When an edit touches reference code or example snippets, validate that the code actually RUNS — not merely that the file exists or parses.** Execute it (or the smallest reproducing harness) against a real target, or trace it line-by-line against the documented API to confirm the control flow does what the prose claims. Files-exist / links-resolve checks do not catch a snippet that throws, loops incorrectly, or no-ops; those surface only at runtime. If you cannot run it this loop, say so and mark it as needing runtime validation in the next real execution rather than reporting it as verified.
   - Check frontmatter, resource paths, line count, compatibility entry, and registry row when metadata changed. If `skill_id` is added or corrected, ensure `.specify/instructions.md` has one deduplicated Skills registry row for the canonical Skill.
   - Accept a directory-level `.github/skills -> ../.specify/skills` symlink as a valid compatibility entrypoint; do not require a separate per-Skill symlink when the directory symlink already exposes the Skill.
   - **After any structural edit to a SKILL.md or its references (moving/renaming/removing a section or file), run the affected contract tests** (`tests/contract/` for the feature that governs the skill) — not just grep for headings. A slimming move can silently break a heading-presence contract test; only executing the tests proves it still passes.
   - **When the suite has pre-existing failures, prove zero regression with a clean-baseline failure-set diff**: capture the sorted `FAILED|ERROR` lines of the full run, produce a clean baseline of HEAD, rerun the same suite there, and diff the two failure sets — an identical set means your change introduced no regression. **Prefer `git worktree add <tmp> HEAD` for the clean baseline**: it is read-only with respect to the working tree and immune to concurrent writers (a running continuous team writing into `.specify/teams/` mid-run can block `git stash pop` and strand a stash entry). Use `git stash -u` + rerun + `git stash pop` only as a fallback when worktrees are unavailable. "The same tests still fail" eyeballed from counts is not sufficient when the baseline itself is red; only the set comparison distinguishes baseline failures from new ones.
   - If a combined validation command returns only partial output or omits later checks, rerun the missing checks individually before concluding validation passed.
   - **Behavior-changing edits get a pressure re-test (RED-GREEN)**: when the edit changes what the Skill *permits or forbids* (new MUST/MUST NOT, gate, or workflow constraint), re-run the pressure scenario that motivated it — a fresh subagent WITHOUT the edit reproduces the failure, WITH the edit complies. Method: `create-skills/references/pressure-testing.md`. Wording-only or resource-path edits are exempt; state which case applied.
   - Do not document `.specify/scripts/` as a Skill-owned resource directory; Skill-owned executable resources belong in `./scripts/`.
   - **Intervention ledger (evidence-step Step E)**: when the run consumed findings evidence, write `intervention.json` into the baseline evidence-run directory (targetFinding / change / baselineRunId / expectedSignal). The next same-target run's `--action compare` decides `Outcome-supported` vs `Unobserved`; never claim "fixed" without that before/after comparison.

7. **Report the feedback-driven changes**
   - Summarize the execution feedback that drove the update.
   - List changed Skill files and the behavior expected to improve next time.
   - Note any unresolved feedback that needs another real execution to validate.

## Quality Checklist

## Agent-Specific Configuration

### Step 1: Identify Executing Agent

Before executing this skill's workflow, identify which AI agent you are:

| Agent | Detection Signals |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code** | System prompt contains "Claude Code"; tools include `Agent`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Read`; `.claude/` directory exists |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Running in VS Code Copilot Chat context; `.github/copilot-instructions.md` loaded; tools include `workspace edit`, `@terminal` |
| **Qoder CLI** | `.qoder/` directory exists; `AGENTS.md` instructions loaded |
| **opencode** | `.opencode/` directory exists |
| **Qwen Code** | `QWEN.md` instructions loaded; `.qwen/` directory exists |
| **Codex CLI** | `.codex/` directory exists |
| **Hermes Agent** | `.hermes/` directory exists |
| **iFlow** | `.iflow/` directory exists |

If you cannot identify your agent, skip Step 2 and proceed with the standard workflow.

### Step 2: Load Agent-Specific Guidance

If you identified your agent in Step 1, check if a guide exists at:

```
${SKILL_HOME}/references/<agent-slug>-guide.md
```

Where `<agent-slug>` is: `claude-code`, `copilot`, `qoder`, `opencode`, `qwen`, `codex`, `hermes`, or `iflow`.

If the guide exists, read it and apply the agent-specific tool mappings, best practices, and pitfall avoidances during execution. If no guide exists for your agent, proceed with the standard workflow.

### Step 3: Capture Execution Feedback

If you encounter an agent-specific obstacle during execution (e.g., a tool call is unavailable, output format doesn't match expectations, a workaround was needed), generate a feedback document at:

```
.specify/memory/feedback/improve-skills-<agent-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>.md
```

The feedback document MUST contain:

```markdown
# Agent Execution Feedback

**Source**: improve-skills
**Agent**: <agent-slug>
**Timestamp**: <ISO-8601>
**Outcome**: <success-with-workaround | partial-failure | full-failure>

## Obstacle
[Description of the agent-specific issue encountered]

## Workaround Applied
[What was done to work around the issue, if anything]

## Suggested Improvement
[Specific change to the skill or reference document that would prevent this issue]
```

Only generate feedback when a genuine agent-specific obstacle was encountered.

## Resources

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|

## Feedback

**Runtime-mode gate.** If `${SKILL_WORKDIR}/.specify/` does not exist, this skill is
running in standalone mode (a non–Spec Kit deployment, e.g. a global agent skills
directory) — skip this entire Feedback step: no engine call, no feedback entry.

At the end of a substantial run of this skill, perform an agent self-reflection step (never solicit feedback content from the user), following the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`:

1. **Gate on qualification & completion.** Only proceed if this run reached a meaningful wrap-up. Skip trivial/no-op runs; for an aborted run use the abort/partial rule below.
2. **Reflect (no user input).** Review this run against this skill's declared purpose and produce a short review plus ≥1 concrete, skill-specific optimization point. If the run was clean, use exactly: `No significant optimization points identified this run.`
3. **Scope guard.** Keep strictly to this skill's operation; do NOT produce a global/whole-project assessment (that is `/speckit.review`'s job). Entries are `scope: local`.
4. **Dedup guard.** Use a stable `run_id`; if a parent flow already recorded feedback for this same `(unit_id, run_id)`, the engine no-ops.
5. **Persist** via the engine:
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR:-.}/.specify/scripts/python/feedback-utils.py" --action record \
     --unit-id "skill:improve-skills" --unit-type skill \
     --run-id "<stable-run-id>" --feature "<feature-key-if-any>" \
     --review "<review prose>" --points-file "<points file>"
   ```
6. **Consolidated submission prompt.** If the returned `should_prompt` is `true`, surface a single consolidated prompt inviting the user to submit collected feedback to the Spec Kit developers; on confirmation run `--action mark-submitted`. Below threshold, do not prompt.

**Abort / partial-run rule.** If the run failed before wrap-up, either skip recording or record with `--partial` and a `## Review` beginning `**Partial run** — `.
