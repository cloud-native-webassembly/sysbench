# Implementation Plan: [SPEC]

**Branch**: `[###-spec-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Requirement → Feature**: `[REQUIREMENTS_KEY]` → Feature [FEATURE_ID] [FEATURE_NAME]
**Input**: Specification from `.specify/specs/[REQUIREMENTS_KEY]/requirements.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command, which **replaces** every `[PLACEHOLDER]` token in place — it MUST NOT append a second copy of this template below the filled content. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED for /speckit.plan:
  Do NOT hard-code principle names here. Instead, read `.specify/memory/constitution.md`,
  enumerate every heading matching `### <roman-or-arabic-numeral>. <name>` (e.g.
  `### I. Template-First Architecture`, `### IV. Test-First Development`), and render
  ONE row in the table below per principle in the exact order they appear in the
  constitution. Include the principle's NON-NEGOTIABLE / MANDATORY annotation verbatim
  when present. This avoids the drift documented in the constitution's Sync Impact Report.

  Each row must contain:
  - Principle (verbatim heading without the leading `### N.`)
  - Compliance ("✅ Pass" / "❌ Fail" / "⚠ Partial — see Complexity Tracking")
  - Evidence (one-line citation pointing at the design artefact that demonstrates compliance)
-->

**Core Principles Compliance** (rendered from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`):

| # | Principle | Compliance | Evidence |
|---|-----------|------------|----------|
| I | [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME] [NON-NEGOTIABLE?] | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠ Partial | [one-line evidence: file or section] |
| II | [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME] [NON-NEGOTIABLE?] | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠ Partial | [...] |
| ... | [continue for every principle declared in constitution.md] | | |

**Gates Status**: [✅ All gates pass / ❌ Specific gate failures with justification — list failing principle numbers and link to Complexity Tracking row]

**Re-check after Phase 1**: [Date and short note when the post-design re-check was run; copy the same table refreshed against the design artefacts]

### Documentation (this spec)

```text
.specify/specs/[REQUIREMENTS_KEY]/
├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command) — see note below
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)

<!--
  research.md conditional guidance:
  Produce `research.md` as a standalone file when Phase 0 research exceeds ~50 lines
  or involves external source evaluation (API docs, vendor comparisons, benchmark data).
  When Phase 0 findings are brief (< 50 lines) and fully resolvable from internal
  investigation (project docs, constitution, existing code), inline them into plan.md
  under the `## Phase 0: Research Review` heading and note in this tree:
  "No standalone research.md — findings inlined below."
-->

### Source Code (repository root)
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED:
  Document ONLY the directories actually changed or created by THIS spec, with a
  one-line purpose per directory. Do NOT invent a generic layout, and do NOT paste
  a "Single project / Web / Mobile" stub if it does not reflect this project.

  Examples of valid shapes (see `.specify/templates/examples/structure-*.md` if
  shipped, otherwise infer from the repo):
    - Single application:           src/, tests/
    - Web app:                      backend/, frontend/
    - Mobile + API:                 api/, ios/ or android/
    - Library / SDK:                src/<package>/, examples/, tests/
    - Monorepo:                     packages/<name>/, apps/<name>/
    - Container-image factory:      images/, script/snippets/, script/build/
    - Code generator / framework:   templates/, scripts/, src/<package>/

  If your project does not match any of these, document what is true. The goal is
  evidence-faithful structure, not adherence to a fixed taxonomy.

  MIRROR OBLIGATIONS: if any changed file has mirrors or generated runtime copies
  (dual-written template dirs, per-tool command copies, script mirrors), list EVERY
  copy explicitly in this tree — missed mirrors are the highest-frequency rework
  source during implementation.
-->

```text
[REPLACE THIS BLOCK with the real directories changed by this spec, one line per dir,
 each followed by `# <one-line purpose>`. Keep it terse — do not enumerate every file.]
```

**Structure Decision**: [Name the shape this spec actually lands in (e.g. "extends the
existing container-image factory by adding two new snippets under
`script/snippets/docker/config/users/` and weaving them into 19 daemon images") and
reference the real directories captured above. Explicitly note any new top-level dir.]

### Mirror Obligations *(mandatory when any changed file has mirrors or generated copies)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: for every source file this spec touches that has mirrors or
  generated runtime copies (dual-written template dirs, skills/ ↔ .specify/skills/,
  shared/ ↔ .specify/shared/, per-tool command copies, script mirrors), list EVERY
  affected copy as a first-class design output. /speckit.tasks turns each row into a
  paired dual-write + diff-verify task; /speckit.implement checks every row off.
  Delete this section only when the spec touches NO mirrored surface.
-->

| Source file (edited) | Mirror / generated copies (must land identically) | Verify |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------|
| [e.g. `templates/commands/x.md`] | [e.g. `.specify/templates/commands/x.md`; `.claude/commands/speckit.x.md`; `.github/prompts/speckit.x.prompt.md`; `.qoder/commands/speckit.x.md`; `.qwen/commands/speckit.x.toml`; `.opencode/command/speckit.x.md`] | [e.g. `diff -q` for mirrors; regenerated copies contain the edit] |

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**
> If no violations, explicitly write "N/A" and remove the table.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
