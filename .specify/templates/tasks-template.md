# Tasks: [REQUIREMENT NAME]

**Requirement ID**: [REQUIREMENT_ID] (from branch name, e.g., 003)
**Requirement Key**: [REQUIREMENTS_KEY] (e.g., 003-speckit-agents-command)
**Related Feature**: [FEATURE_ID] [FEATURE_NAME] (from .specify/memory/features.md)
**Input**: Design documents from `.specify/specs/[REQUIREMENTS_KEY]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), requirements.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests Mode**: [ON | OFF] — derived from `.specify/memory/constitution.md` by `/speckit.tasks`. State the principle (or absence) that drove the decision.

**Tests**: When Tests Mode is ON, the examples below include test tasks and they are MANDATORY. When OFF, remove the test rows entirely (do NOT leave empty placeholders).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Definition of Done (DoD)

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define the completion criteria that apply to all tasks in this document.

  IMPORTANT FORMAT RULE: DoD rows MUST NOT use the `- [ ]` / `- [X]` checkbox syntax.
  Reason: that syntax is reserved for individual task rows below, and tooling that counts
  `grep -cE '^- \[ \]'` for "open work" would otherwise conflate DoD items with tasks.

  DoD rows use the `- DoD-N:` prefix instead, with an explicit `Status:` line at the end
  of this section tracking overall DoD state. Add/remove `DoD-N` rows freely.

  CORRECT examples:
    - DoD-1: Code implemented according to specification
    - DoD-2: All automated tests pass (unit, integration, contract)

  INCORRECT examples (NEVER use these in the DoD section):
    - [x] Code implemented according to specification    ← WRONG: checkbox syntax
    - [ ] All automated tests pass                       ← WRONG: checkbox syntax

  LINT CHECK: If any line between `## Definition of Done` and the next `##` heading
  matches the regex `^\- \[[ xX~]\]`, the format rule is violated and the file must
  be corrected before proceeding.
-->

- DoD-1: Code implemented according to specification
- DoD-2: All automated tests pass (unit, integration, contract)
- DoD-3: Manual verification completed where applicable
- DoD-4: Documentation updated (inline comments, README, etc.)
- DoD-5: Code reviewed and approved
- DoD-6: Changes validated against success criteria from requirements.md

**DoD Status**: pending | green   <!-- flip to `green` only when every DoD-N row above is satisfied -->

## Completion Gate

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define machine-checkable gate items that /speckit.implement MUST
  re-validate against the current tree before declaring the run complete — the
  all-tasks-[X] state alone is NOT trusted. Each item names the concrete check
  command that proves it. Same format rule as DoD: use `- GATE-N:` prefix, never
  checkbox syntax.

  A gate item is satisfied only by running its check NOW and reading the output
  (see implement.md's IDENTIFY→RUN→READ→VERIFY→CLAIM gate function). After 3
  consecutive failed re-validations with no newly closed item, implement STOPS
  and escalates instead of retrying.
-->

- GATE-1: Full test suite has zero NEW failures vs recorded baseline — check: `scripts/bash/run-tests.sh` + `comm -13 baseline current`
- GATE-2: Every mirror obligation from plan.md verified byte-identical — check: `diff -rq <source> <mirror>`
- GATE-3: No `[ ]` or `[>]` task rows remain — check: `grep -cE '^- \[[ >]\]' tasks.md` returns 0
- GATE-4: verification.md lists every SC-NNN with a status — check: grep SC ids against requirements.md

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- **[blockedBy: T001,T002]** (optional): explicit dependency tag — this task MUST NOT start until every listed task is `[X]`. Machine-checkable alternative to prose like "depends on T012"; prefer it whenever a dependency exists. Tasks without the tag follow phase order only.
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- **Verification tasks**: Add explicit manual QA/verification tasks when they are separate from automated tests

### Task State Sigil (REQUIRED)

Each task row starts with one of the checkbox states below. They are first-class — `/speckit.implement` parses them and `/speckit.review` enumerates them across features.

- `- [ ]` — **Open**. Task has not been completed. A run is NOT complete while any `[ ]` remains.
- `- [>]` — **Claimed / in progress**. Used only in multi-agent runs: an executor flips `[ ]`→`[>]` when it picks the task up, so parallel workers never double-claim. Single-agent runs may skip this state. A `[>]` left behind by a dead worker is reclaimable after verifying no fresher evidence exists.
- `- [X]` — **Closed**. Task has been fully executed and verified.
- `- [~]` — **Deferred**. Task is intentionally handed off to the user (or to a later phase). Reasons must be recorded in `verification.md` under `deferred_tasks=` and ideally a one-line `<!-- deferred: <reason> -->` inline comment on the task row itself. Typical deferral causes: Layer-2 docker smoke build requiring a real docker daemon, external system access not available in CI, multi-day backfill.

A `/speckit.implement` run is considered complete when **zero `[ ]` or `[>]` rows remain**. `[~]` rows are allowed at completion and surface in the run summary's "Deferred Tasks" block.

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from requirements.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.

  The samples are APP-SHAPED (models/services/endpoints). For template-only,
  documentation, or prompt-framework specs, use the doc-feature taxonomy
  instead (author-section / mirror-parity / render-verify / refresh-verify —
  see the /speckit.tasks command's "Doc-feature phase shape") and turn every
  row of plan.md's Mirror Obligations table into a paired dual-write +
  diff-verify task set.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

> OMIT this phase entirely (and renumber subsequent phases) when the feature has no
> blocking prerequisites — e.g. pure template/governance/documentation features. Do
> NOT keep an empty phase header with "(no tasks)".

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (MANDATORY) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Manual Verification for User Story 1 (if required)

- [ ] T011A [US1] Manual QA: validate [user journey] using quickstart.md steps

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T014 [US1] [blockedBy: T012,T013] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (MANDATORY) ⚠️

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Manual Verification for User Story 2 (if required)

- [ ] T019A [US2] Manual QA: validate [user journey] using quickstart.md steps

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (MANDATORY) ⚠️

- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Manual Verification for User Story 3 (if required)

- [ ] T025A [US3] Manual QA: validate [user journey] using quickstart.md steps

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation
- [ ] TXXX Manual QA sweep for critical paths

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- **Deferral discipline**: prefer `[~]` over leaving a task `[ ]` "for now" — `[~]` is a deliberate handoff with a recorded reason, while `[ ]` blocks completion and signals unfinished work.
