## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Process `$ARGUMENTS` per the [User Input Protocol](.specify/shared/workflow/user-input-protocol.md). If empty, execute the **Default Behavior (No Arguments)** defined below. If non-empty but intent is ambiguous or unsupported, report capabilities and request the missing intent (do NOT guess silently). If a `tool_id` and a natural-language hint conflict, stop and request correction.

## Outline

`/speckit.tools` is the **single entry point** for every **tool** operation — the tool-domain analogue of `/speckit.agents` and `/speckit.team`. It recognizes intent, then routes to the owning tool skill. It delegates to skills and does **NOT** render templates inline.

A **tool** is a named, pre-verified, reusable **definition of one concrete capability** — persisted at `.specify/memory/tools/<name>.md` — that an agent invokes *instead of* working out how to perform that action on the fly. It is an **abstraction layer between an agent's intent and the environment's reality**, and it removes two failure modes of the unmediated default:

- **Environment variance** — the same logical capability is not the same command everywhere: the binary may be named differently, be a different version, need different flags per version, or differ by CPU architecture or OS. An agent reasoning from training knowledge picks one plausible invocation and gets it wrong on the machine actually present. A record pins what is **verified here** and states the known variance explicitly.
- **Throwaway generated scripts** — for anything non-trivial an LLM otherwise writes ad-hoc script code in the moment, varying in quality and correctness and differing **between runs**, so behavior is not reproducible. A record replaces per-run improvisation with something verified once and reused thereafter.

That buys **stability** (same behavior across runs, sessions, and agents), **efficiency** (no re-deriving or re-validating the invocation, so less inference overhead), and **authority** (the record's behavioral rules **override the agent's built-in training knowledge**). Hence **definition is the primary action** and discovery only bootstraps a `Draft` for the user to complete — a record auto-filled from model knowledge would defeat its own purpose. The operating rule for every other skill/command is **reuse before generating**: check for an existing tool before writing script code for a complex action (`.specify/shared/workflow/tool-reuse-gate.md`; Constitution Principle XII).

> **Terminology**: unqualified "tool" here means the record above. A supported coding agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, …) is an **AI agent CLI**; the `tools:` frontmatter key on an agent is its **tool-call list**.

Every record has four canonical types (`project-script`, `system-binary`, `shell-function`, `webhook`), an optional `## Environment Applicability` block (verified version, version differences, platform, architecture, fallback, preflight check), and a two-state lifecycle (`Draft` → `Verified`); only `Verified` records may be invoked. Type semantics, the RFC 2119 behavioral-rules format, environment applicability, the reuse gate, edge cases, and the invocation preview contract are defined once in `.specify/shared/definitions/tool-definitions.md`. The authoring templates live inside the owning skill at `skills/create-tools/templates/`.

### Modes → Capability Routing

`/speckit.tools` exposes **exactly five** modes:

| Mode | Recognized intent | Delegates to |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| **define** | "定义工具", "创建工具", "新增工具", "注册工具", "define a tool", "create/add/register a tool" | `create-tools` skill |
| **modify** | "修改工具", "优化工具", "更新工具", "改工具规则", "modify/improve/fix a tool", "add alias", "verify tool" | `improve-tools` skill |
| **view** | "查看工具", "看下这个工具", "view/show a tool" | read-only display (see View / List Mode) |
| **list** | "列出工具", "有哪些工具", "list tools" | read-only display (see View / List Mode) |
| **invoke** | "调用工具", "执行工具", "跑一下", "invoke/run/execute a tool" | invocation gate (see Invoke Mode) |

**Routing flow**:

1. **Recognize intent** from `$ARGUMENTS` and conversation/repo context: classify as `define`, `modify`, `view`, `list`, or `invoke`.
2. **Resolve the record** — check `.specify/memory/tools/<tool-name>.md` and alias matches. When the same name exists under different types, require explicit user disambiguation and present all matching records.
3. **define** → `create-tools`: collect the mandatory fields **from the user** (never auto-populate a tool's contract from built-in knowledge), author the record from the matching type template, validate, persist with a generated `tool_id`, and register it. If the record already exists, inform the user and offer `modify` or `view` instead.
4. **modify** → `improve-tools`: load the existing record and apply **field-level** edits only — source/contract correction, rule hardening, alias/rename, or `Draft` → `Verified` promotion. Preserve every unmodified field; re-validate and re-persist. If the record does not exist, report "no definition found" and offer to `define` it.
5. **view / list** → read-only display; never mutate a record (see View / List Mode below).
6. **invoke** → follow the **preview → confirm → execute** gate below.
7. **Empty arguments** → execute **Default Behavior (No Arguments)** below.
8. **Non-empty but ambiguous / unsupported** → report capabilities and request the missing intent (see "Ambiguous or Unsupported Intent" below).

### Default Behavior (No Arguments)

When `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, the command MUST execute the following sequence instead of routing to a mode:

1. **List all registered tools** — scan `.specify/memory/tools/*.md` and present a summary table with each tool's `name`, `tool_type`, `source_identifier`, and `status`. If no records exist, state "No tools found" explicitly.
2. **Give contextual suggestions** — based on the current conversation, recent repo activity, and the listed records, recommend the most relevant next action. Examples: a `Draft` record blocking use → suggest `modify` to complete it; a script the conversation keeps invoking by hand → suggest `define` it; a `Verified` record matching the current task → suggest `invoke`. Suggestions MUST be grounded in observable context, NOT fabricated.
3. **Show capability summary** — briefly list the five modes so the user knows what operations are available.

This behavior is informational and non-destructive: it MUST NOT define, modify, or invoke any tool without explicit user instruction.

### Ambiguous or Unsupported Intent

When intent cannot be resolved from non-empty arguments, the command MUST report the recognized capabilities and request the missing intent. It MUST NOT guess silently or fail without a message. Report this capability listing:

- **define** — author a new tool definition record with authoritative behavioral rules → `create-tools`
- **modify** — correct or strengthen an existing record, or promote it to `Verified` → `improve-tools`
- **view** — display one record's full definition
- **list** — show a summary table of all records
- **invoke** — preview a resolved invocation and execute it only after explicit confirmation

### View / List Mode

Read-only, never mutating:

- **view** — load the record and display its full definition: fields, parameters, returns, behavioral rules, aliases, `status`, `discovery_origin`, and `tool_id`. If no record exists, report "no definition found" and offer to `define` it.
- **list** — display a summary table of all records under `.specify/memory/tools/`. Distinguish `Draft` from `Verified` so incomplete records are visible.

### Invoke Mode (preview → confirm → execute)

Invocation is gated. The command MUST NOT execute a tool before explicit user confirmation:

1. **Load** the record and require `status: Verified`. A `Draft` record MUST block invocation — guide the user to complete the definition via `modify` instead.
2. **Preview** using the Invocation Preview format in `.specify/shared/definitions/tool-definitions.md`: the resolved command, resolved parameter values, the record's behavioral rules, and the expected output shape.
3. **Confirmation gate** — prompt `Proceed with execution? (yes/no)` and execute **only** on an explicit `yes`. On anything else, stop without executing and record the session as `cancelled`.
4. **Execute** exactly what was previewed — do NOT modify parameters beyond the preview — while honoring the record's behavioral rules as authoritative over built-in knowledge.
5. **Record the session** — `tool_name`, `tool_id`, `resolved_command`, `result_status`.

### Persistence

- Definition records: `.specify/memory/tools/<name>.md`; `tool_id` is the canonical form `<TOOL:.specify/memory/tools/<name>.md>`.
- Registry: exactly one row per tool in the `### Tools` table of `.specify/instructions.md` (`## Resource Registry`), inside the `<!-- TOOLS_REGISTRY_START -->` / `<!-- TOOLS_REGISTRY_END -->` range. This range is owned by the tools domain; `/speckit.instructions` does not reconcile it.
- `.specify/memory/tools.md` is the **discovery inventory** regenerated by `refresh-tools.sh` — it is not a definition record and MUST NOT be hand-edited by these modes.

## Agent-Specific Configuration

### Step 1: Identify Executing Agent

Identify which AI agent is executing this command:

| Agent | Detection Signals |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Tools include `Agent`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Read`; `.claude/` directory exists |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Running in VS Code Copilot Chat context; `.github/copilot-instructions.md` loaded |
| **Qoder CLI** | `.qoder/` directory exists; `AGENTS.md` instructions loaded |
| **opencode** | `.opencode/` directory exists |
| **Qwen Code** | `QWEN.md` instructions loaded; `.qwen/` directory exists |
| **Codex CLI** | `.codex/` directory exists |
| **Hermes Agent** | `.hermes/` directory exists |
| **iFlow** | `.iflow/` directory exists |

If you cannot identify your agent, skip Step 2 and proceed with the standard flow.

### Step 2: Load Agent-Specific Guidance

Check whether a guide exists for the routed skill at:

```
.specify/skills/<create-tools|improve-tools>/references/<agent-slug>-guide.md
```

If it exists, apply its tool mappings and pitfall avoidances during execution. Otherwise proceed with the standard flow. For shared operational guidance, see `.specify/shared/workflow/agent-configuration.md`.

### Step 3: Capture Execution Feedback

If you hit a genuine agent-specific obstacle (an unavailable tool call, an output format mismatch, a needed workaround), write a feedback document to:

```
.specify/memory/feedback/tools-<agent-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>.md
```

Include: **Source** (`/speckit.tools`), **Agent**, **Timestamp**, **Outcome**, then `## Obstacle`, `## Workaround Applied`, and `## Suggested Improvement`. Only generate feedback when a genuine agent-specific obstacle was encountered.

## Feedback

At wrap-up (the same lifecycle point where this command prompts for a Git commit), perform an agent self-reflection step (never solicit feedback content from the user), following the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`:

1. **Gate on qualification & completion.** Only proceed if this command reached its wrap-up stage. Skip trivial/no-op runs; for an aborted run use the abort/partial rule below.
2. **Reflect (no user input).** Review this run against `/speckit.tools`'s declared purpose and produce a short review plus ≥1 concrete, command-specific optimization point. If the run was clean, use exactly: `No significant optimization points identified this run.`
3. **Scope guard.** Keep strictly to this command's operation; do NOT produce a global/whole-project assessment (that is `/speckit.review`'s job). Entries are `scope: local`.
4. **Dedup guard.** Use a stable `run_id` (e.g. the feature key + a run timestamp); if a nested skill/command already recorded feedback for this same `(unit_id, run_id)`, the engine no-ops.
5. **Persist** via the engine:
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR:-.}/.specify/scripts/python/feedback-utils.py" --action record \
     --unit-id "/speckit.tools" --unit-type command \
     --run-id "<stable-run-id>" --feature "<feature-key-if-any>" \
     --review "<review prose>" --points-file "<points file>"
   ```
6. **Consolidated submission prompt.** If the returned `should_prompt` is `true`, surface a single consolidated prompt inviting the user to submit collected feedback to the Spec Kit developers; on confirmation run `--action mark-submitted`. Below threshold, do not prompt.

**Abort / partial-run rule.** If the run failed before wrap-up, either skip recording or record with `--partial` and a `## Review` beginning `**Partial run** — `.

## Documentation

At the same wrap-up point as the Feedback step, apply the docs-sync evaluation per the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/docs-step.md`: assess whether information produced by this run (new capabilities, key decisions, structural changes) needs to be recorded into the project documentation space, and conclude with exactly one of `需记录（目标文档 + 要点）` or `无需记录`. Never block wrap-up; incremental judgment only (no full reconcile sweep); when a move/archive-level change is needed, recommend running `/speckit.docs` instead of executing it here.

## Handoffs

**Before**: Use when you need to externalize and reuse tool records with strict behavioral rules that outrank the agent's built-in knowledge.

**After**: Tool records are available for agent permissions wiring and the `/speckit.instructions` registry.
